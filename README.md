2028: A very intense solar storm has just hit... The MARC - MArs Rover Cartograph rover, which was carrying out its mission very well, has suffered a malfunction. Its programming, guidance and movement systems have been seriously affected...

The ESTF, Efrei Space Task Force, has called on programming experts to design new travel software for MARC. Your mission is to use this travel software to bring MARC back to a base station where it can be refurbished.
