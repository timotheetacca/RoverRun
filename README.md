## Introduction  

**2028:** A very intense solar storm has struck Mars, causing a critical failure in the MARC (*MArs Rover Cartograph*).  
MARC’s programming, guidance, and movement systems have been severely impacted.  

The **ESTF** (*Efrei Space Task Force*) has enlisted programming experts to design new travel software to guide MARC back to its base station for refurbishment.  
Your mission is to leverage this travel software to save MARC!
